- ### Project Goal

Between July 23rd-30th, 2018, [Carr](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-carr-fire-map/) fire ignited and spread over the Santa Rosa county in California, USA. It resulted in destruction of nearly 1,500 houses, and killing six people. The damage was enormous. We decided to look into the damages to the houses through satellite imagery techniques, to assess the level of damage.

- ### Problem statement
---
CAn we train a model that will look at the differnetial (pre/post) satellite image and discern the damage extent?

### <span style="color: green">Project structure
    
The import, data process, as well as modeling and visualizatons were all performed in python. The project directory is structured as follows:
```
project-global_warming_NLP
    
|__ assets/
|__ codes/
|  |__ P01_API_requests.ipynb  
|__ datasets/
|__ plots/
|__ Executive_slides_satellie_CNN.pdf
|__ README.md
```

The project was first run on a small dataset of only one satellite image pairs, then was extended to 30 images.
